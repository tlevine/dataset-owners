I once tried contacting the "data owner" for a dataset hosted
on a Socrata site, and I read that Flowing Data just did too.
In neither case did we get responses. So what exactly does this
data owner thing do?

## The Contact Dataset Owner feature
If you go to a dataset page on a Socrata Open Data Portal website,
you'll see something like this.

![A Socrata dataset page](example/6jva-hr4v-1.png)

There's an "About" button that opens this screen.

![The "About" button](example/6jva-hr4v-2.png)

Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see "Contact Dataset Owner".

Then you can fill out the contact form,

![Filling out the form](example/6jva-hr4v-4.png)

which includes a CAPTCHA.

If you submit the form and all goes well, you'll see something like this.

!["The dataset owner has been notified"](example/6jva-hr4v-6.png)

This is the feature that I mentioned in the beginning. Until conducting
the present study, I had no idea what happens after you submit the form.
But now I do! Let's find out.

## Questio44
I mainly wanted to answer this.

> If I contact the owner of a dataset on a Socrata website, what is the chance
> that I will receive a response at all?

Secondarily, I am curious as to whether that "owner" is the right person.

> If I contact the owner of a dataset on a Socrata website, what is the chance
> that the person will be the appropriate contact person?

## Methods
I sent emails to a sample of the data owners asking whether they
are still appropriate contacts for their datasets. They could respond
with "yes" or "no". They could also not respond. I checked which ones
responded, and I came up with some figures related to the above questions.

### Sampling
I downloaded metadata on
[all public datasets](http://thomaslevine.com/!/socrata-summary/)
from all the Socrata websites I knew about and then looked at the
[owners](http://thomaslevine.com/!/socrata-genealogies/) of the different
datasets. I treated this as a population of owners of public datasets.
I drew a sample from this population, and I tried to send questionnaires
to every owner in the sample.

My [sampling script](http://small.dada.pink/dataset-owners/bin/sample)
is parametrized by a salt.

    SALT=elephant ./sample.R

This produces a file called "messages.csv" containing a record for each
of the sampled users. Each record contained the URL of a dataset owned
by the user and the message that I should send to the user. 

### Messages
Messages looked like this.

    Dear [fullname],
    
    My name is Thomas Levine, and I have been studying how governments
    publish data. I am contacting you because you are listed as the
    "dataset owner" for the following datasets.
    
    https://data.somecity.gov/d/abcd-efgh
    https://data.somecity.gov/d/ijkl-mnop
    
    I would like to know whether you are the person I should contact about these datasets.
    
    If you are still the contact, please go to this web page.
    http://dataowners.thomaslevine.com/astoehusahul982h3cuhose/yes
    
    If you are no longer the contact or never were the contact, please go to this web page.
    http://dataowners.thomaslevine.com/astoehusahul982h3cuhose/no
    
    And feel free to email me if you have any questions or comments.
    
    Thanks

The message contained a unique identifiers the user that had been chosen
as a hash of the salt and the Socrata identifier for the owner. I did this
so that a hypothetical troublemaker would have difficulty messing with my
data. I kept the salt value secret, and I can reproduce the sampling based
on the salt.

### Configuring the server for receiving responses
I pointed the domain "dataowners.thomaslevine.com" was pointed to my
virtual server at the [Numb Server Association](https://the-nsa.org).
On this computer, an Nginx server was configured with these properties.

* Listen only on "dataowners.thomaslevine.com".
* Serve the same [exit page](http://small.dada.pink/dataset-owners/exit.html)
    regardless of the HTTP request.
* Store logs to files specific to the "dataowners.thomaslevine.com"
    server, as to not confuse it with other domains on the same website.

I backed up the log files periodically and saved the final versions
after a few weeks.

### Contact procedure
I wrote a little
[thingy](http://small.dada.pink/dataset-owners/bin/messages)
that made it easier for me to contact the owners. This program
guided me through the whole process of contacting the owners,
remembering all of the annoying things for me.

It checks which owners have been contacted and selects one of
the owners that hasn't been contacted. It tells me which URL
to go to and gives me the text to put in the message to the
dataset owner.

<!-- An image could go here. -->

I ran my messages program thingy and went to the URLs that it
told me to go to. I filled in the following information

* Reason: "Other" (the default)
* Subject: "A visitor has sent you a message about your ... dataset" (the default)
* Message: Copy this from the output of the message-sending guide program
* Email address: "dataowners@thomaslevine.com"

and submitted the form.

I recorded in my little program any unexpected results of the form
submission (mostly error messages).

### Reading server logs
Recall that the server logs record clicks on the "yes" or "no" links
that I included in the messages to dataset owners.

I wound up with a data table where each row was a dataset owner and
where the two columns corresponded to the owner hash (identifier)
and the response (yes or no).

[Here](http://small.dada.pink/dataset-owners/bin/log-parser) are the
details of how I converted the log files into a CSV file of two columns.

### Reading emails
Three people responded by email, and I combined their responses with
the data table produced above.

Oklahoma's Office of Management and Enterprise Services sent me an
email saying that my message had been marked as spam, so I counted
them as not having responded to my contact.

## Results
I'll first discuss what I learned about Socrata's dataset owner contact
feature. Then, I'll discuss what I learned from the dataset owners once
I contacted them.

### Socrata product things


* Size limit (I suspect that it's a limit on the number of characters in a database field.)
* Intended for copyright and privacy issues rather than clarifications on the dataset

### Errors in sending
Sending the messages turned out to be more diffucult than I had expected.
(explain the errors and limits)

XXX
ggsave(filename = 'figures/undocumented-limit.png', plot = p1, width = 8)
ggsave(filename = 'figures/undocumented-limit-zoomed.png', plot = p2, width = 8)

It seems that people with more datasets respond differently
from people with fewer datasets.
(That is, there is sampling bias.)

ggsave(filename = 'figures/send-rate.png', plot = p1, width = 8)
ggsave(filename = 'figures/how-many-datasets.png', plot = p2, width = 8)
ggsave(filename = 'figures/sampling-bias.png', plot = p3, width = 8)

Thus, we should keep in mind that the 
thing I'm about to tell you might only apply to people with few datasets.

### How/whether owners respond
Recall that I had two questions.

1. If I contact a dataset owner on a Socrata website, what is the chance
    that I will receive a response at all?
2. If I contact a dataset owner on a Socrata website, what is the chance
    that the person will be the appropriate contact person?

> If I contact a dataset owner on a Socrata website, what is the chance
> that I will receive a response at all?

The probability of yes or no (rather than no response) from an owner

The probability of yes or no (rather than no response) from an owner,
weighted by the number of datasets that the owner owns


2

> If I contact a dataset owner on a Socrata website, what is the chance
> that the person will be the appropriate contact person?

The probability of yes from an owner

The probability of yes from an owner,
weighted by the number of datasets that the owner owns



### Were people who owned many datasets different from people who owned few
Recall that I weighted my sample towards owners with lots of datasets.
I did this because I suspected that people with lots of datasets would be
different from people with few datasets. I wanted to estimate the response
rate by dataset rather than by owner. (I was interested in the experience
that someone consuming the data would have.) This is why the above statistics
are all weighted by the number of datasets that an owner owns.

A side effect of this manner of sampling is that I can check whether owners
with many datasets were different from owners with few datasets. Below is
a plot to this effect.

XXX p4 goes here

Each dot is a dataset owner. Its horizontal position is randomly chosen,
its vertical position corresponds to the number of datasets the owner owned,
and its color corresponds to whether the owner responded to my contact.
The squigly shapes in the back are violin plots, which are like smoothed
versions of the points.

The shapes of the two sides of the plots are sort of similar but also sort
of different. Based on the plot, I'd guess that there probably is a small
difference in whether an owner responds depending on whether the owner has
many or few datasets.

We can get a fancier result with a logistic regression of whether the
owner responded (She either did or didn't.) on the number of datasets the
owner owned.

XXX m4 goes here.

Given how many owners I contacted, the term for the number of datasets
(XXX) isn't large enough that we should guess that there truely is some
difference in response rates based on the number of datasets an owner owns.
Said more fancy-like, the *p*-value for the slope (rather than intercept)
term is above our conventional *&alpha;* of 0.05.

It turned out that people with lots of datasets were quite similar to
people with few datasets, so I have similar answers to both of the research
questions.
