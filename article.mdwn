I once tried contacting the "data owner" for a dataset hosted
on a Socrata site, and I read that Flowing Data just did too.
In neither case did we get responses. So what exactly does this
data owner thing do?

## The Contact Dataset Owner feature
If you go to a dataset page on a Socrata Open Data Portal website,
you'll see something like this.

![A Socrata dataset page](example/6jva-hr4v-1.png)

There's an "About" button that opens this screen.

Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see "Contact Dataset Owner".

Then you can fill out the contact form,

which includes a CAPTCHA.

If you submit the form and all goes well, you'll see something like this.

!["The dataset owner has been notified"](example/6jva-hr4v-6.png)

This is the feature that I mentioned in the beginning. Until conducting
the present study, I had no idea what happens after you submit the form.
But now I do! Let's find out.

## Questio44
I mainly wanted to answer this.

> If I contact a dataset owner on a Socrata website, what is the chance
> that I will receive a response at all?

Secondarily, I am curious as to whether that "owner" is the right person.

> If I contact a dataset owner on a Socrata website, what is the chance
> that the person will be the appropriate contact person?

## Methods
I sent emails to a sample of the data owners asking whether they
are still appropriate contacts for their datasets. They could respond
with "yes" or "no". They could also not respond. I checked which ones
responded, and I came up with some figures related to the above questions.

### Sampling
XXX
The population of owners of public datasets were determined from
the search endpoints of several Socrata Open Data Portal websites.
A sample was drawn from within this population, and questionnaires
were sent to each of them over email.

Run the following command to produce repeated systematic samples
of dataset owners along the number of datasets per owner.

    SALT=elephant ./sample.R

This will produce a file called "messages.csv".
I have recorded the `SALT` value that I used and will
publish it after I've collected the responses.

I sent this to that and blah blah

sampling this and that

sent these messages with this program

### Configuring the server for receiving responses
The domain "dataowners.thomaslevine.com" was pointed to Tom's
virtual server with the [Numb Server Association](https://the-nsa.org).
On this server, an Nginx server was configured with these properties.

* Listen only on "dataowners.thomaslevine.com".
* Serve the same [exit page](exit.html) regardless of the HTTP request.
* Store logs to files specific to the "dataowners.thomaslevine.com"
    server, as to not confuse it with other domains on the same website.

I backed up the log files periodically and saved the final versions
after a few weeks.

### Contact procedure
I wrote a little
[thingy](http://small.dada.pink/dataset-owners/bin/messages)
that made it easier for me to contact the owners. This program
guided me through the whole process of contacting the owners,
remembering all of the annoying things for me.

It checks which owners have been contacted and selects one of
the owners that hasn't been contacted. It tells me which URL
to go to and gives me the text to put in the message to the
dataset owner.


XXX

The information should be the same for every form
that you fill out except that the message should change.
Use the following values.

* Reason: Other (the default)
* Subject: "A visitor has sent you a message about your ... dataset" (the default)
* Message: Copy this from the second ("message") column of the spreadsheet.
* Email address: dataowners@thomaslevine.com

Finally, write something (anything) in the empty "sent" column.
If you are sending these messages in multiple sittings,
you might want to record the date and approximate time
when you sent the message. But you can also just write something
like "1" or "yes".

If you didn't send the message, leave the "sent" column blank.
(for example, if the form didn't work). You can record
why you didn't send it in the empty "notes" column.

### Reading server logs
Recall that the server logs record clicks on the "yes" or "no" links
that I included in the messages to dataset owners.

I wound up with a data table where each row was a dataset owner and
where the two columns corresponded to the owner hash (identifier)
and the response (yes or no).

[Here](http://small.dada.pink/dataset-owners/bin/log-parser) are the
details of how I converted the log files into a CSV file of two columns.

### Reading emails
Three people responded by email, and I combined their responses with
the data table produced above.

Oklahoma's Office of Management and Enterprise Services sent me an
email saying that my message had been marked as spam, so I counted
them as not having responded to my contact.

### Preparation for analysis
The separate analysis CSV file prepared during the sampling process
contains the owner hash that is included in the query string in the
messages sent to the contact form. I used this to join information
from the search endpoint about the dataset owner to the dataset owner's
questionnaire response.

## Results

### Errors in sending
Sending the messages turned out to be more diffucult than I had expected.
(explain the errors and limits)

## Results
I'll first discuss what I learned about Socrata's dataset owner contact
feature. Then, I'll discuss what I learned from the dataset owners once
I contacted them.

### Socrata




It seems that people with more datasets respond differently
from people with fewer datasets.
(That is, there is sampling bias.)



Thus, we should keep in mind that the 
thing I'm about to tell you might only apply to people with few datasets.
