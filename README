I once tried contacting the "data owner" for a dataset hosted
on a Socrata site, and I read that Flowing Data just did too.
In neither case did we get responses. What is this data owner thing?

I'm sending emails to all of the data owners asking whether they
are still appropriate contacts for their datasets. They can respond
with "yes" or "no" or not respond.


## Sampling
Repeated systematic samples along the number of datasets

Run like so.

    SALT=elephant ./sample.R

## Contact procedure
Run the sampling process listed above. This will produce a file
called "messagess.csv". If only one person is going to contact
people, you're finished generating files; if not, you just need
to split this into a few files, one per person, so that people
don't accidentally duplicate efforts.

Once you have one file per person, each person as follows.
Open the file inside a spreadsheet program. The left column is
URLs of Socrata-hosted datasets, and the right column is what
should be pasted inside the contact form. Go to that URL,
click on "About", then "Contact Dataset Owner", and fill out
the form.

![Clicking on a URL in a spreadsheet]()

![Arriving at the Socrata dataset]()

![Clicking on "About"]()

![Clicking on "Contact Dataset Owner"]()

![Filling out the form]()

The information should be the same for every form
that you fill out except that the message should change;
copy the message from the right column of the spreadsheet.

Finally, put something in the empty "sent" column.
Leave the column blank if you didn't send the message
(for example, if the form didn't work). You can record
why you didn't send it in the empty "notes" column.
