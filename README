I once tried contacting the "data owner" for a dataset hosted
on a Socrata site, and I read that Flowing Data just did too.
In neither case did we get responses. What is this data owner thing?

I'm sending emails to all of the data owners asking whether they
are still appropriate contacts for their datasets. They can respond
with "yes" or "no" or not respond.


## Sampling
Run the following command to produce repeated systematic samples
of dataset owners along the number of datasets per owner.

    SALT=elephant ./sample.R

This will produce a file
called "messagess.csv". If only one person is going to contact
people, you're finished generating files; if not, you just need
to split this into a few files, one per person, so that people
don't accidentally duplicate efforts.

## Contact procedure
Once you have one file per person, each person as follows.
Open the file inside a spreadsheet program. The left column is
URLs of Socrata-hosted datasets, and the right column is what
should be pasted inside the contact form. Go to that URL,
click on "About", then "Contact Dataset Owner", and fill out
the form.

![Clicking on a URL in a spreadsheet]()

![Arriving at the Socrata dataset]()

![Clicking on "About"]()

![Clicking on "Contact Dataset Owner"]()

![Filling out the form]()

The information should be the same for every form
that you fill out except that the message should change.
Use the following values.

Reason: Other (the default)
Email address: dataowners@thomaslevine.com
...
Messsage: Copy this from the second ("message") column of the spreadsheet.

Finally, put anything in the empty "sent" column.
If you are sending these messages in multiple sittings,
you might want to record the date and approximate time
when you sent the message.

If you didn't send the message, leave the "sent" column blank.
(for example, if the form didn't work). You can record
why you didn't send it in the empty "notes" column.
