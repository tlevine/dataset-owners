I once tried contacting the "data owner" for a dataset hosted
on a Socrata site, and I read that Flowing Data just did too.
In neither case did we get responses. What is this data owner thing?

I'm sending emails to all of the data owners asking whether they
are still appropriate contacts for their datasets. They can respond
with "yes" or "no" or not respond.


## Methods
The population of owners of public datasets were determined from
the search endpoints of several Socrata Open Data Portal websites.
A sample was drawn from within this population, and questionnaires
were sent to each of them over email.

Responses to the questionnaires are recorded in Nginx server logs

### Sampling
Run the following command to produce repeated systematic samples
of dataset owners along the number of datasets per owner.

    SALT=elephant ./sample.R

This will produce a file called "messages.csv".
I have recorded the `SALT` value that I used and will
publish it after I've collected the responses.

### Configuring the server
The domain "dataowners.thomaslevine.com" was pointed to Tom's
virtual server with the [Numb Server Association](https://the-nsa.org).
On this server, an Nginx server was configured with these properties.

* Listen only on "dataowners.thomaslevine.com".
* Serve the same [exit page](exit.html) regardless of the HTTP request.
* Store logs to files specific to the "dataowners.thomaslevine.com"
    server, as to not confuse it with other domains on the same website.

The resulting logs were versioned in git and periodically pushed to
public locations.

### Contact procedure
Open the file inside a spreadsheet program. The left column is
URLs of Socrata-hosted datasets, and the right column is what
should be pasted inside the contact form. Go to that URL,
click on "About", then "Contact Dataset Owner", and fill out
the form.

![Clicking on a URL in a spreadsheet]()

![Arriving at the Socrata dataset]()

![Clicking on "About"]()

![Clicking on "Contact Dataset Owner"]()

![Filling out the form]()

The information should be the same for every form
that you fill out except that the message should change.
Use the following values.

Reason: Other (the default)
Email address: dataowners@thomaslevine.com
...
Messsage: Copy this from the second ("message") column of the spreadsheet.

Finally, write something (anything) in the empty "sent" column.
If you are sending these messages in multiple sittings,
you might want to record the date and approximate time
when you sent the message. But you can also just write something
like "1" or "yes".

If you didn't send the message, leave the "sent" column blank.
(for example, if the form didn't work). You can record
why you didn't send it in the empty "notes" column.

### Reading server logs
Server logs were run through the [???]() program, which produced
a CSV file of two columns: owner hash and response (yes or no).

### Preparation for analysis
The separate analysis CSV file prepared during the sampling process
contains the owner hash that is included in the query string in the
messages sent to the contact form. I used this to join information
from the search endpoint about the dataset owner to the dataset owner's
questionnaire response with the program [xXX]().
