I once tried contacting the "data owner" for a dataset hosted
on a Socrata site, and I read that Flowing Data just did too.
In neither case did we get responses. What is this data owner thing?

I'm sending emails to all of the data owners asking whether they
are still appropriate contacts for their datasets. They can respond
with "yes" or "no" or not respond.
