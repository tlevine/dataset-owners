I would like to answer this question:

I sent this to that and blah blah

sampling this and that

sent these messages with this program

### Errors sending
Sending the messages turned out to be more diffucult than I had expected.
(explain the errors and limits)

## Results
I'll first discuss what I learned about Socrata's dataset owner contact
feature. Then, I'll discuss what I learned from the dataset owners once
I contacted them.

### Socrata




It seems that people with more datasets respond differently
from people with fewer datasets.
(That is, there is sampling bias.)



Thus, we should keep in mind that the 
thing I'm about to tell you might only apply to people with few datasets.
