Dear {{fullname}},

My name is Thomas Levine, and I have been studying how governments
publish data. I am contacting you because you are listed as the
"dataset owner" for the following
{{len(datasets)}} dataset{{'s' if len(datasets) > 1 else ''}}.

{{dataset['url'] + '\n' for dataset in datasets}}

If you are still the contact for these datasets, please click on the following link.
http://dataowners.thomaslevine.com/?person=2hu9eh2runuoe823hplu09uh&owner=yes

If you are no longer the contact or were never the contact, please click on the following link.

If you have any questions or comments, please reply to this email.

Thanks

Tom
